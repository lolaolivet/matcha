# Issues

## Creating issues (ticket)

You can always create an issue immediately without asking anyone.<br>
How you do it depends on whether the issue is pressing or not.

| What happens then : | The team will discuss it on the next sprint planning meeting | Communicate immediately about the ticket to the team, so that problems like duplicate issues can be caught quickly <br><br> **Then if you are sure everything is fine** : <br> - if you want to work on it directly, you can then assign it to yourself and label it `In Progress`<br> - if you want to work on it later during the sprint (or for someone else to do it later during the sprint), label it&nbsp; `On Deck` |

## Working on an issue

If an issue is `On Deck`, you are allowed to work on it.

Here are the steps to take to start working on an issue :

* Assign the issue to yourself (and anyone who is working on it with you)
* Label the issue `In Progress`
* Create a branch named `[issue_number]-[terse_description_of_the_issue]` (exple for issue #42 : `42-fixing_A`)

## Finished working on the issue

When you are done working on your issue, **submit a _Merge Request_ and let someone else check your code**.

NB : you could, in theory, review your code yourself since we are not using a paid plan, but don't. Your code should be reviewed by someone else, like this the four of us can have a good visibility on the project. Also, our code will be better for it!).

### Code Review Guidelines

GitLab's [Code Review Guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/code_review.html) is an excellent ressource, some of it is specific to GitLab, but most of it applies to this project (mainly the parts concerning responsibility and best practicies). It is not very long, I strongly advise you to read it.

# What documents do I refer myself to ?

## API references

Here is [a good short article on RESTFUL API design](https://hackernoon.com/restful-api-designing-guidelines-the-best-practices-60e1d954e7c9)

The document [apis.md](apis.md) features informations on how to design the API, the document [api-swagger.yml](api-swagger.yml) is the actual precise design of the APIs, it can be visualised by pasting it into [app.apiary.io/](https://app.apiary.io/) or [editor.swagger.io/](https://editor.swagger.io/), whichever you prefer.

## Database references

The design is described on [database-graph.png](database-graph.png) and there is a draft of future additions and suggested changes in [database.md](database.md).

## Implementation guidelines

Matcher : 
There are details about the inner workings of the matcher in [matcher.md](matcher.md)

# Testing

The profile API is tested using a script generated by oatts (Source for decision of using oatts : https://community.apigee.com/questions/46811/api-integration-test-generation-from-swagger-spec.html)

To run tests manually in `server/profile`, run `npm run test:integration`
